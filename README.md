football-sweepstakes
====================

## Foooootbaaaallll!!!

Use this to generate sweepstakes for the 2014 Brasil World Cup.

...Ya bunch o' gamblers! :)

(Built in under an hour as a mini-hackathon.)

### Instructions

* Type your friends'/coworkers' names into the textbox.
* Click **Assign Teams** to generate a list (any remainder will automatically be struck from the list).
* Click **Save Assignment** to save a JSON dump of the sweepstakes assignments. You will need to save this from your browser if you'd like to load it ever again.
* You can load the JSON file back in to display the table, if you like!

### Tech info ("To whom it may concern...")

* This is built using the wonderful [minified.js](http://minifiedjs.com/), a super-lightweight DOM library (yes, it works as a jQuery replacement!) by Tim Jansen.
* [PURE](http://purecss.io/) was used as a very lightweight replacement for Bootstrap/Foundation/you-name-it.
* This will work in the latest range of browsers and is totally untested on earlier ones.
